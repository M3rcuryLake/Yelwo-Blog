                    <p>Sooo...its been long since an update, and I felt kinda guilty for not being able to write anything (im lazy). Well, I pulled off some massive shits, like Lofi-Cafe, the heritage of this site, which functions by playing live streaming music from lofi girl's channel on youtube and lets you listen to lofi without using that CPU intensive youtube site....and also saves your data...which is pretty impressive. This thing was commited to this site last year early November or so.....and has seen some darn heavy interfaces and interface changes. Scripting the javascript was a tedious task but somehow with help of some "god-like-web-developer-having-a-blog", I pulled it off (and if u want that help too, link's out <a href="https://gist.github.com/philcook/cb38130b8649c46f1e9091b490664ab8">here</a>)....and I customised it so that screens having less than 600px browser display area will get a different JS code than the devices having more than 600px browser display area, and if you want to examine it, inspect the screen and you will have the source infront of you. I had to write the script inside script tags cuz the response times were awfull...its pretty complex so I will look into that matter later, probably serperate it to a JS file.</p>
<p>And Ive also been experimenting with cloud based servers and did manage to host a onion server, free of cost, and learnt a lot. Its pretty easy...even if ubuntu's apt doesnt directly support tor hidden services...its not that hard to put the sources to the sources.list file and doing a simple install and setup...I wanted to customise the hostname to something like 'alecxb73edq727a....onion' with a vanity address generator like mkp224o or others, but as it turns out, shared hosting service doesnt let you do some cpu intensive shit and get away with it. As I found out, generating a public key and a private key for a single hostname does take up CPU power...generating a hostname with given initials of five letters take at max sixteen minuites...while seven letters takes days....eleven and above isnt practicaly possible as sitting for a thousand years for a single hostname isnt a popular hobby (<a href="https://www.jamieweb.net/blog/onionv3-vanity-address/">refer to this page</a>). I shut down the server cuz being regular and maintaining isnt my thing.</p>
<p>And...well, Ive mastered the intermidate of Python and the art of CSS, learnt the basics of both JavaScript and C Language, and probably learn PHP or SQL or both after that...but before that...I think I will put out a static site generator....with python and using tailwind css (Im in love with that), functioning almost identically to hugo (not exactly) OR a basic encryption methodolgy with the plain text going in through a complex multiple encoding, then a SP-box, then a LSFR, then XOR-ing it, repeating that with the next round of bytes, or text, producing some high entropy block of gibberish...(Shoutout to Alan Turing).....you know....have been playing around with algorithms and Andrew S. Tanenbaum books lately...</p>
