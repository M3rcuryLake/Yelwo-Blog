Sooo....I have spend more than a hundred hours looking for a free vps, and I think I found it....a company by the name of mogenius.com allows users to create Ubuntu 18.04 VPS or Alpine Linux VPS (it also allows Nginx and other preconfigured templates and databses...check out the docs for more info)...guess what? I got one of those sweet Ubuntu bionic releases and it already feels good to know that I have spare PC in the cloud, to which I can ssh anytime I want...They are like the "free alternative" to the high-end cloud services like digital ocean or linode. Better check it out now.

Unfortunately heroku is closing its doors to the free tier on 28th November, which, i bet, will be a sad day for most developers out there....Cmon, the free progessql and the option of "not using docker" was awesome. And if you want to migrate, you have to docker-ize your whole server code (assuming you are using buildpacks) to make it work on any cloud service (or toaster)....which is again a pain in the ass.

Well...to share my ideas....I want to work with JavaScript for a while....built something like a Spotify clone....but...you know the problem I have is "where to store all that 4gb (okay... -i cut it down to 1gb) of songs".....which got me another brilliant project idea, why not try and build a storage bucket with a automated python upload script?.....(even 500mb is usefull in such cases.....python means cross-platform and no GUI intendive shit)....anddd.....*maybeee* a python web browser....uk, *maybe*...
